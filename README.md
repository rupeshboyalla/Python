# Python

1. What is differnce between Python and Java:

  **Java is a statically typed**:  In Java, all variable names (along with their types) must be explicitly declared. Attempting to assign an object of the wrong type to a variable name triggers a type exception. That’s what it means to say that Java is a statically typed language.
  Java container objects (e.g. Strings and ArrayList) hold objects of the generic type Object, but cannot hold primitives such as int. To store an int in a Vector, you must first convert the int to an Integer. When you retrieve an object from a container, it doesn’t remember its type, and must be explicitly cast to the desired type.
  **Example**:

    int    myCounter = 0;
    String myString = String.valueOf(myCounter);
    if (myString.equals("0")) ...


**Python is Dynamically typed**: In Python, you never declare anything. An assignment statement binds a name to an object, and the object can be of any type. If a name is assigned to an object of one type, it may later be assigned to an object of a different type. That’s what it means to say that Python is a dynamically typed language.
Python container objects (e.g. lists and dictionaries) can hold objects of any type, including numbers and lists. When you retrieve an object from a container, it remembers its type, so no casting is required.
  **Example**:
  
    myCounter = 0
    myString = str(myCounter)
    if myString == "0": ...
