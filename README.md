# Python

1. What is differnce between Python and Java:

Java is a statically typed:  In Java, all variable names (along with their types) must be explicitly declared. Attempting to assign an object of the wrong type to a variable name triggers a type exception. That’s what it means to say that Java is a statically typed language.

Java container objects (e.g. Strings and ArrayList) hold objects of the generic type Object, but cannot hold primitives such as int. To store an int in a Vector, you must first convert the int to an Integer. When you retrieve an object from a container, it doesn’t remember its type, and must be explicitly cast to the desired type.
